This Android application simulates a Point of Sale (POS) system for restaurant table service. It allows users to place orders for food and drinks and facilitates easy payment processing. The application interacts with external APIs to fetch food and drink data and displays them in separate recycler views. Users can navigate through the app using a navigation bar, and the data is stored and retrieved using shared preferences. Additionally, customers receive external notifications on their phones when they complete a payment.
